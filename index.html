            <h1>DIY Fix Cleric in Mod 19</h1>
            <h2>Keybindings</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>/bind ctrl gfxsetdefaultfov 85 - Increase FOV so we can see the battlefield. Bind it to something as it likes to reset itself.</li>
                <li>/bind f1 +InventoryExec inventory 0 - Lets you use the item in your first inventory slot just by pressing the button. Similar mappings can be made for as many slots as you want (up to the first 42). This is useful for usings pots, or revive teammate items from the inventory without slotting them and wasting a belt slot.</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <h2>Macros</h2>
            <p>The goal is to seperate the different abilities that are all on tab into different buttons. They are Mark of Divinity, Light of Divinity (with battle prayer up), Light of Divinity (without battle prayer), Angel of Life / Scattering Light.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mark of Divinity: Create a macro that presses tab for 1ms. I suggest binding it to the middle mouse button. THis will allow you to move your mark without worrying.</li>
                <li>Light of Divinity: Create a macro that presses tab for 1 second. This is to trigger the full heal with Battle Prayer up (hopefully most of the time). I put this on another mouse button. Create another that holds tab for 2 seconds for when Battle Prayer is not up.</li>
                <li>Combo Mark of Divinity then Light of Divinity: I also made a macro that chains moving of the mark and initiating a 1s channel heal. I left 35ms between these actions and it lets me definitely target a player with a 1s Light of Divinity even when I can't see my mark.</li>
                <li>Angel of Life / Scattering Light: You could create a macro that holds tab for 3.1s (yes 3 seconds is actually not enough). I put this on V.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="markimg">
                .
            </div>
            <p>When using a 1s Light of Divinity this way it just feels like another one of clerics long cast animations, and not a channelled ability. Tab is still available for variable heals or preemptively getting ready to release the heal. I also just use tab to activate angel.</p>
            <br />
            <h2>Powers</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The class feature "Switch Prayers" is required so you can still move around with all the channelling you'll be doing. This really should be an inherent part of cleric now.</li>
                <li>I suggest always having at least 1 of Divine Glow OR Intercession on your hotbar to aid with divinity management. Exaltation can also do a similar job.</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <h2>Feats</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Persistent Guardian is infinitely better than Anointed Arms. Just choose it and we can move on.</li>
                <li>Battle Prayer is basically required to make Light of Divinity a viable power which we need because then it is much better than our other powers. Beware that when the buff is up (most of the time) it is very hard to re-place your mark without healing instead. Use the macros discussed earlier to avoid this bug.</li>
                <li>I suggest using Empowered Soothe since then Soothe is actually good and we can use that for an at-will that does more to 1 player than a bastion on 5 would to 1 of those hit. We can use it to heal 1 target in a crowd where bastion couldn't. Even if you use healing word I just don't see much benefit to the feat regarding it since the tick healing is unreliable and let's be honest, you don't have that many ways of healing people now. Not that you should be spamming anyway.</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <h2>UI</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Moving your buffs into the middle of the screen is helpful for spotting when angel of life is up</li>
                <li>moving your teammates buffs to the middle of the screen is useful for seeing your healing word status. You can also see who is marked by Mark of Divinity via the buff bar</li>
                <p>The resulting UI:</p>
                <div class="uiimg">
                    .
                </div>
            </ul>
        </div>
